Note: for changing remote name from origin to any other name first remove origin using: 
i. git remote remove origin
ii. git remote add <new_remote_name> <github_repo_name_URL>.git

Whether to accept the pull request merge or not first you need to test the code
Go to the fork of your project (the user who forked your repo and sent you pull request)
git remote add <name_for_new_remote> <URL_of_the_fork>.git

git remote -v (here you will get list of 2 remotes)

git branch <branch_name>   --> creates new branch
git checkout <branch_name>  --> switch to that branch

git pull <name_for_new_remote> <branch_name>
eg. Usually -->  git pull origin master

check code if runs properly then commit using :
git commit -m "<message>"

git checkout master

git merge <branch_name>

git push <remote_name> master  --> remote name is origin
